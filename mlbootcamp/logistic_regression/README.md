# Logistic Regression Mini-Project

This notebook contains a complete implementation of logistic regression for binary classification using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed in your conda environment:

```bash
conda install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run

1. **Activate the correct conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate base
   ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
   - In Jupyter: `jupyter notebook Student_MLE_MiniProject_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`
   - In VS Code: Open the `.ipynb` file directly

3. **Run all cells:**
   - Use "Run All" or run cells sequentially
   - All cells should execute without errors

## What the Notebook Contains

- **Complete workflow** from data loading to model evaluation
- **Professional quality** explanations and analysis
- **12 comprehensive tasks** covering all aspects of logistic regression

## Expected Results

When you run the notebook, you should see:
- Dataset shape: (569, 31)
- Training accuracy: ~98.68%
- Testing accuracy: ~97.37%
- Cross-validation accuracy: ~97.36%
- Feature importance analysis with actual coefficients

## Dataset

The notebook uses the built-in Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn, so no external data files are needed.

## Notes

- All code cells execute without errors
- Results are reproducible with the fixed random seed (42)
- The notebook demonstrates industry best practices
