# Deep Learning Mini-Project

This notebook covers neural networks and deep learning using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The **Student_MLE_MiniProject_Deep_Learning.ipynb** notebook includes:

1. Building a simple neural network from scratch with NumPy
2. Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
3. Creating a neural network with Keras
4. Training and evaluating the model

## What's Covered
