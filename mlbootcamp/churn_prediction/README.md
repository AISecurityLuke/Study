# Customer Churn Prediction - MLE Mini Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications service. The notebook covers the entire ML workflow from data exploration to model deployment considerations.

## Project Structure
- `Student_MLE_MiniProject_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## Features
- **Data Generation**: Creates realistic synthetic telecom churn data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive visualization and statistical analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features and handles categorical variables
- **Model Comparison**: Tests multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses GridSearchCV to optimize the best model
- **Business Insights**: Provides actionable recommendations for customer retention

## Key Sections
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** - Understanding the dataset structure
2. **Target Variable Analysis** - Examining churn distribution and class imbalance
3. **Feature Analysis** - Visualizing relationships between features and churn
4. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values and encoding variables
5. **Model Training** - Training and evaluating multiple models
6. **Feature Importance** - Understanding key factors influencing churn
7. **Model Tuning** - Optimizing hyperparameters
8. **Final Evaluation** - Confusion matrix, ROC curves, and classification reports
9. **Business Insights** - Actionable recommendations for retention strategies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter: `jupyter notebook Student_MLE_MiniProject_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells sequentially to see the complete analysis

## Expected Outcomes
